            Our project is utilizing the Prince George’s County Open Data Portal
            to get data on housing inspection violations. Our application analyzes
            areas with higher violations and pinpoint the specific violations that
            tend to require multiple inspections and legal action.

            For the proposed system, we can create a tool that prospective
            homeowners can utilize when they’re considering buying a house in a
            specific area. Users will be able to identify problematic violations
            in the housing area as well as areas with a high amount of housing
            violations. Since the data and metadata we’re looking at is constantly
            being updated on a weekly basis, this tool will be recent enough for
            consistent use in the future. If we can automate the collection of
            data from the PG county data catalog, our application will be helpful
            in organizing the data in a way that anyone can draw the right
            conclusions.

            We’ve decided to use the FETCH API as an interface for us to fetch
            resources. This would provide a means to handle requests, returning
            promises and thus resolving responses. We would initially start with
            the FETCH API using its conventions, but as we would go on in the
            semester, we would move from only getting the data to doing more
            asynchronous requests. Regarding front-end technology, we will be
            using HTML to give our web application a frame, CSS to make it
            presentable, bootstrap to give it a template, Javascript to make it
            functional, JSON to enter data, Python FETCH API to handle request and
            response. As we move further in the semester and learn new
            technologies, we would incorporate them as we go along.
